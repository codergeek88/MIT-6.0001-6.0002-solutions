problem sets from 2 semester intro CS course publicly available on MIT OpenCourseware

I primarily learned to code by watching all of the lectures and completing all of the problem sets for the 6.0001 and 6.0002 courses on MIT OpenCourseware

this repository contains all of the problem set solutions (as well as some other scattered exercises) for the two courses
